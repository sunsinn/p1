    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I am a cataloging and metadata librarian at the <a href = "http://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library"> Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America</a>. I have a B.S. in Film and Photography from Ithaca College and a Masters in Library and Information Science from Simmons College.
    </p>
    <h3>Why I am taking this course</h3>
    <p>
      I audited <a href = "http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cscie10/Fall2013/">CSCI E-10</a> two years ago to get a little programming under my belt and enjoyed it enough that I continued on to <a href = "http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cscie22/">E-22</a> and <a href = "http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cscie66/">E-66</a>. As librarianship increasingy involves work with linked data, large data sets, and online services of all kinds, I thought it would be a good idea to continue my professional development in those areas.
    </p>
    <h3>Programming experience</h3>
    <p>
      The bulk of my programming experience is in Java. I have done some work with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, though nothing recently besides a Codeacademy course to brush up on the basics - I took my previous website down in 2003! Over the past year, I've focused on data structures and databases - SQL, XML in conjunction with BerkeleyDB, and NoSQL.
    <p>
    <p>
     My work for this semester will be done on a laptop running Windows 7.
